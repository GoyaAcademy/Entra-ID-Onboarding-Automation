pattern:
  type: "sso-sp-initiated" # sso-idp or sso-sp
  justification: "Since users start sign-in from the application (SP-initiated) and the app is not registered yet, SP-initiated SAML is suitable. Lack of PKCE support and no app proxy or KCD simplifies the deployment in production environment."
