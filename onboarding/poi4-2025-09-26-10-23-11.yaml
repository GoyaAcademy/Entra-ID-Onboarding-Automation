pattern:

  justification: "Users access application directly via URLs, and the app currently uses local username/password auth. SP-initiated SSO is chosen since users start login from the app. Protocol defaults to SAML due to unknown OIDC support, with no PKCE, no app proxy, and claims include email and name."
